# code_sample
A simple project to show some code samples.

The project contains the core codes to train a speaker verification (SV) front-end (speaker embedding network). The speaker embedding network consists of a TDNN-based frame-level network, a statistics pooling layer, and an utterance-level layer. The code is based on pytorch.

For the default training parameters, you may use "python train.py" to train the front-end.
